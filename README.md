This is a static site built with Vue & Nuxt.
There is only a single page for this Nuxt site, but we still use components to keep the content nicely split up.
For styling, we are using SCSS and pulling in only the bits of the Bulma framework that we need, as well as some custom styling.

## Development

```bash
$ npm ci

Run a version of the site with hot reload enabled on localhost:3000:
```bash

```

Lint the project code before committing:

```

Automatically fix some linting errors:
```bash

```

```bash
$ npm run analyze
```

## Production
